# BYU Job Seeker
BYU Job Seeker is a Node.js program that allows the students at BYU to find their desired job on campus by selecting the departments and job categories. The job title and description links will be saved into the table after the students choose the job, so they can later view their job choices. The students can remove the job from the table if they wish.

# APIs
This program uses the following APIs:
1. Person v3
2. Job_Openings v1 (all the sites)
3. Job_Openings v1 (job families specified)
4. Job_Openings v1 (specified job families)
